## Contents and tutorial ##
** Step 1 **
Look at the *data_exploration* and *xBD_data_processing* notebooks to understand how data preprocessing is done and building crops are generated.

** Step 2 **
Look at all the *image_loading* files to understand how images are prepared for training.

** Step 3 **
Look at the *Cao_Choe_model_1*, *vgg16_model*, and *image_loading_with_model_training_tf2.8.3* to understand how the CNNs are trained.

** Step 4 **
Look at the *xBD-test-set-predictions* and *marash_predictions* to understand how conventional transfer learning and simulation testing are conducted.

** Note **
Samples of training data are included in the two folders.
